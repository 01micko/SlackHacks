insync is Google Drive for business and power users that sync and 
supports multiple accounts and offline Google Docs editing using 
local applications.

This package provides client application for KDE

Note: This SlackBuild Script can be used to build client app 
for XFCE (or probably any other DE) with minor modification, 
but it will replace the KDE menu entry with other DE's menu entry, 
so it's highly recommended to use only one DE when using insync
