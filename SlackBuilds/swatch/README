Swatch.pl started out as the "simple watchdog" for activly monitoring
log files produced by UNIX's syslog facility. It has since been 
evolving into a utility that can monitor just about any type of log.

Note: Sometimes it's better to run perl -MCPAN -e shell and perform
"upgrade" first before installing the dependencies below to make
sure you have the core's packages upgraded to the latest stable version

Requires:
- perl-Date-Calc
- perl-Date-Manip
- perl-File-Tail
