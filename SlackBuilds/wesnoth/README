The Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy
environment, where players can build an army of different kinds of
fighters from races such as elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, and more.

It is a turn-based strategy game on a hexgrid with several challenging
single-player campaigns and different kind of multi-player matches.

If you want to compile the wesnothd server and campaign server you can
run the script as follows:   SERVER=yes ./wesnoth.SlackBuild

please note that the server UID and GID are not required at compile time but
will be required at runtime under the UID/GID specified in the buildscript.
You can create the user and group for the wesnoth server as follows:

# groupadd -g 229 wesnoth
# useradd -u 229 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -g wesnoth wesnoth

I tried to rebuilt this package using DEBUG in order to find any problem, but
it turned out that it worked and no more segfaults, so i'll try to use debug
instead of release for now and see what happened next

Let me know if this solution does (not) work on your system
