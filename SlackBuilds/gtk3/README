This is my personal attempt to build GTK+3 on Slackware-Current
This script is based on Slackware's official SlackBuild script with some modifications
required to build correctly

Known Problems:
- libgtk-x11 is not available, so it breaks some applications that requires this library

TODO:
- Migration from GTK+2 still needs to be tweaked 

Requirements: 
- gobject-introspection 1.32.1 (Available on SBo)
- pango-1.30
   - gdk-pixbuf 2.26.1
- atk-2.4.0
   - glib2-2.32.1
     - libffi-3.0.11 (Available on SBo)
