foomatic-rip is a universal print filter, which is used by CUPS with
the gutenprint and hplip printer drivers.  It translates PostScript
(and also other file formats) to the printer's native language,
usually using Ghostscript (gs) as the external renderer.  The way
this translation is done is described in a PPD file.

To use BEH (wrapper for CUPS backends with configurable error handling):
- restart CUPS (/etc/rc.d/rc.cups restart)
- see if beh has been included (lpinfo -v | grep beh )
- check your original queue name and URI for your device (lpstat -v)
- activate beh for your print queue 
  (lpadmin -p <queue name> -E -v beh:/<dd>/<att>/<delay>/<originaluri>)
  with 
  <queue name>:     The name of your print queue
  <dd>:             Don't Disable, if "1", beh always exits with zero
                    status, so the queue gets never disabled when the
                    original backend exits with an error. "0" carries
                    the error status of the last call of the backend
                    (after <att> retries) on to CUPS, so the queue
                    usually gets disabled.
  <att>:            Attempts, number of attempts to recall the backend
                    in case of an error. "0" means infinite retries. In
                    this case <dd> gets meaningless.
  <delay>:          Delay between two attempts to call the beckend, to
                    be given in seconds and as an integer number.
                    Meaningless if <att> is one.
  <originaluri>:    The original URI, which your queue had before. Can 
                    be determined with "lpstat -v".

Example:
Original queue name and URI: 
lpstat -v
