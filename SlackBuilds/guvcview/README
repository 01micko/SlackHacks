guvcview (GTK+ UVC Viewer)

This project aims at providing a simple GTK interface for capturing and
viewing video from devices supported by the linux UVC driver, although
it should also work with any v4l2 compatible device.

This requires portaudio, PulseAudio (optional), gtk+3 and ffmpeg.

If you don't have PulseAudio, please use
PULSE=NO ./guvcview.SlackBuild (default: YES)
